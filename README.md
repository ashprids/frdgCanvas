frdgCanvas is a drawing software made with Python that uses GTK3 for the GUI and Pygame for the drawing canvas.

This is a personal project I took up during the summer of 2024. It took over 4 days to create.

The software comes with a brush that draws basic shapes to simulate a pen, an eraser, a mode for creating pixel art and a directory for you to create your own brushes.

Check out the documentation for more information on how to use the software!
